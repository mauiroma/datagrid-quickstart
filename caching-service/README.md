Author: Sebastian ≈Åaskawiec
Level: Intermediate
Technologies: Infinispan, OpenShift
Summary: The `online-services` quickstart demonstrates how to connect to a deployed JDG Online Services
Target Product: JDG
Product Versions: JDG 7.2

What is it?
-----------

The `online-services` quickstart demonstrates how to connect to a deployed JDG Online Services.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to run this project one needs to have an access to local OpenShift installation with JDG Caching Service installed. Follow [the documentation](https://github.com/jboss-container-images/jboss-dataservices-image) how to do it.

You can use local OpenShift all-in-one cluster. To prepare you local OpenShift cluster follow [the documentation](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md).

Furthermore, if you are using the ExternalOpenshiftClient quickstart, you must ensure that you expose the caching-service-app-hotrod
service via a route which has passthrough encryption, e.g. `oc create route passthrough caching-service-endpoint-hotrod --port=11222 --service caching-service-app-hotrod`

System requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or better, Maven 3.0 or better and OpenShift 3 client.

Configure Maven
---------------

If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.

Configure Client
----------------

You need to configure the authentication and service parameters in the client to match the values utilised when creating the caching-service.
If you are deploying the quickstart to openshift in `DeployedOpenshiftClient` you must change the values of the USERNAME, PASSWORD and
APPLICATION_NAME class variables to the appropriate values.

If you are running the quickstart locally in `ExternalOpenShiftClient` you must change the values HOT_ROD_ENDPOINT_ROUTE, USERNAME, PASSWORD and
APPLICATION_NAME class variables to the appropriate values.

Build the Quickstart
--------------------

Type this command to build the quickstart:

        mvn clean package

Run the Quickstart on Openshift
------------------

Run the following command

        mvn fabric8:run

This will deploy this service into OpenShift and connect to a default deployed Online Service. The plugin uses already configured and connected
 `oc` or `kubectl` client, so make sure you are already authenticated and proper Project has been selected.

The expected output should be displayed on the console (the same that was used to invoke `mvn fabric8:run`).
Here is an example of the command's output:

After you're happy with the results, just hit ctrl-c on the console. The Fabric8 Maven Plugin will undeploy client application.

Run the Quickstart Locally
------------------
Run the following command

        mvn exec:java

This will attempt to connect to an external openshift instance running a caching-service. This quickstart uses already
configured and connected `oc` client, so make sure you are already authenticated and the correct project has been selected.

Remember, on openshift you must ensure that you expose the caching-service-app-hotrod
service via a route which has passthrough encryption, e.g. `oc create route passthrough caching-service-endpoint-hotrod --port=11222 --service caching-service-app-hotrod`
