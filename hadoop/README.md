hadoop: Example using the JBoss Data Grid Hadoop connector 
=========================================

Authors: Gustavo Fernandes  
Level: Intermediate  
Summary: The `hadoop` quickstart demonstrates how to use Apache Flink to process data from JBoss Data Grid using the JBoss Data Grid Hadoop Connector.  
Technologies: Apache Flink, JBoss Data Grid, Hadoop   
Target Product: JDG  
Product Versions: JDG 7.x  
Source: <https://github.com/infinispan/jdg-quickstart>

What is it?
-----------

The `hadoop` quickstart will populate a cache with football match results for a given championship. 
Each match has a home team, an away team, and the number of goals each scored. 
An Apache Flink job will process that data and generate the championship standings, where each winning 
team gets 3 points, loosing teams get none, and if there's no winner, each team gets 1 point. 
This sample demonstrate access to the Data Grid data using standard Hadoop `InputFormat` and `OutputFormat` interfaces.

System requirements
-------------------

 * JDK 8+
 * Maven 3+
 * JBoss Data Grid 7.2.0
 * Apache Flink v1.0
 
Configure Maven
---------------
 
If you have not yet done so, you must [Configure Maven](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) before testing the quickstarts.

Start the JDG Server
---------------------

1. Obtain the JDG server distribution on Red Hat's Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/listSoftware.html
2. Start JDG
    * Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JDG directory.
    * The following shows the command line to start the server:
    
            For Linux:   $JDG_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c clustered.xml 
            
            For Windows: %JDG_HOME%\bin\standalone.bat -c clustered.xml 
            
Start Apache Flink
--------------------

1. Download and unpack v1.0 of [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html#binaries). On Windows, you can use 7-zip to extract the .tgz file.  
The extract location will be referred as `FLINK_HOME`.

2. Start Apache Flink
    * Open a command line and navigate to `FLINK_HOME`
    * The following shows the command line to start the server:
    
            For Linux:   bin/start-local.sh
            
            For Windows: bin\start-local.bat 
            
The Flink dashboard will be visible at <http://localhost:8081>

Build the Quickstart
----------------------------

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](../../README.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JDG and Flink as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

               mvn clean package
               
Load Data in the cache
------------------------------

To load the matches contained in the `matches.txt` file:

   * Open a command line and navigate to the `hadoop` quickstart directory.
   * Run the following command to populate the cache:
   
        java -cp target/jboss-hadoop-quickstart-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.infinispan.quickstart.hadoop.DataLoader

Run the analysis job
----------------------------

The `ChampionshipStandings` job will process the matches and calculate the classification table. 

To run the job:  

 * Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
 * Run the following command to run the job:
 
         For Linux:   
             $FLINK_HOME/bin/flink run target/jboss-hadoop-quickstart-jar-with-dependencies.jar
                  
         For Windows:
             set FLINK_CONF_DIR=%FLINK_HOME%\conf
             %FLINK_HOME%\bin\flink run target\jboss-hadoop-quickstart-jar-with-dependencies.jar


The output should print the table, showing Atletico Madrid on top:
